The **_Decision Making Adventure_** is a personal project of mine that I have made using various coding techniques in Java along with implementing everything through a GUI made with Java Swing.

Various techniques used include implementing JLibrary components, using Interfaces, Action Event Listeners, Timers, and TimerTasks.

## How can this game be played?
> When you start the game, you will be given some statistics for your character: Health: 10 and Comfort: 10.
> You will be given various different decisions as you progress through the game that may alter your future outcomes!
> As the stages progress, the character's statistics will decrease after each stage by a random amount, or based on the decisions that you make.
> The goal is to get through all of the stages successfully without your statistics reaching 0.
